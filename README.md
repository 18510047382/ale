## Introduction

Ale.js (Chinese meaning: 啤酒) is a framework only for user view operation. 

Unlike other large frameworks, Ale.js core library only focuses on view layer, which is not only easy to use, but also easy to integrate with third-party libraries or existing projects. 

After compression (non-g-zip), it has only about `11kb` file size, and its execution speed is extremely fast. More importantly, Ale. JS can help you quickly build flexible pages and drive your complex pages!
